Here's a more detailed explanation of the code:
Importing necessary modules
unittest: This is the built-in Python module for unit testing.
patch: This is a decorator from the unittest.mock module that allows us to temporarily replace (or "mock") the behavior of a function or module during a test.

Defining the test class
TestGetCredentials: This is a subclass of unittest.TestCase, which is the base class for all test cases in the unittest module.
unittest.TestCase provides a number of assertion methods (like assertEqual) that we can use to verify the behavior of our code.

Defining the test method
test_get_credentials: This is a method of the TestGetCredentials class that contains the actual test code.
The @patch decorators are used to temporarily replace the input and getpass.getpass functions with mock versions that return predetermined values. This allows us to control the input to the get_credentials function and isolate it from external dependencies.
Inside the test method, we call get_credentials() and store the returned values in username and password.
We then use the assertEqual method to verify that the returned values match the expected values.

Running the tests
if __name__ == '__main__':: This is a guard clause that ensures the tests are only run when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module by another script).
unittest.main(): This runs the tests using the unittest test runner.
By writing tests like this, we can ensure that our code behaves correctly and catch any bugs or regressions early in the development process.
